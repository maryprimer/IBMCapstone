## About IBMCapstoneProjectPresentation.pdf 
This is a summary presentation that includes an introduction to

**Although it mimics a professional
presentation, it includes information that <b>would not be included </b>if it was not created for the 
purpose of evaluation. I have included the given template for the presentation for reference
