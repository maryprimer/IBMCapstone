# IBMCapstone
This is the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification, the project uses 
real word data pertaining to SPACEX commercial launches.

IBMCapstoneProjectPresentation.pdf is a summary presentation that includes an introduction to 
the project as well as descriptions of what was done in the lab. Although it mimics a professional
presentation, it includes information that would not be included if it was not created for the 
purpose of evaluation. I have included the given template for the presentation for reference.
